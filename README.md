# Layoffs Data Cleaning Project (MySQL)

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates SQL data cleaning techniques using a layoffs dataset.

The goal was to transform raw data into a clean and analysis-ready dataset.

## Tools Used
- MySQL
- Excel (for viewing datasets)

## Data Cleaning Steps
The following SQL techniques were applied:

1. Removed duplicate records using ROW_NUMBER()
2. Standardized text data using TRIM() and formatting updates
3. Handled NULL and blank values
4. Removed unnecessary columns

## SQL Skills Demonstrated
- Window Functions
- CTEs
- Data Cleaning Techniques
- String Functions
- ALTER TABLE operations

## Files Included
- raw_layoffs_data.csv → Original dataset  
- cleaned_layoffs_data.csv → Final dataset  
- data_cleaning.sql → SQL cleaning process

## Outcome
The dataset is now structured and ready for exploratory data analysis or visualization.
